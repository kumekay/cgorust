## Educational tasks for C, C++, Rust and Go

I'm ruby and python developer, but one month ago I've started to learn "Latin" and "Greek" of software development - C++.
I read the book "C++ Primer Plus (6th Edition)" written by Stephen Prata.

C++ is cool but not alone. So I decided to write all exercises in 4 languages (where possible):

- *C++*
- *C* - as default language for embedded development
- *Go* - modern standard for high performance server apps
- *Rust* - new and very interesting C/C++ replacement
