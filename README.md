## Educational tasks for C, C++, Rust and Go

I'm ruby and python developer, but one month ago I've started to learn "Latin" and "Greek" of software development - C++.
I read the book "C++ Primer Plus (6th Edition)" written by Stephen Prata. And I want to finish this book by the end of 2015.

C++ is cool but not alone. So I decided to write all exercises in 4 languages (where possible):

- *C++11* - as newest version of C++ with some sugar.
- *C* - as default language for embedded development (Reference: C Primer Plus, Fifth Edition by Stephen Prata)
- *Go* - modern standard for high performance server apps (Reference: https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-go-book, http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)
- *Rust* - new and very interesting C/C++ replacement (Reference: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

All code compiled for Mac OS X x86-64 platform
